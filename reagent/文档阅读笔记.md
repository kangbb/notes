## Using Hiccup-- r/render

```shell
r/ render [component DOM]
           |-- can be A React Element
           |---can be ClojureScript vector
                      |--vector first posiontion can be `:div` or `span`
                      |--vector first posiontion can be `symbol`
                                                         |--such as `Hiccup vecotr`, i.e `page` in `[page[...]`
                                                         |--such as `ClojureScript function`, which will be `render` function
                                                         |--such as `React component`, i.e somesome`TextInput` in [:> rn/TextInput [...]]
```

## Using Hiccup-- Expanding seqs

use `for` to expand, only for **list**.<br/>
Note that while lists are considered to be seqs by Clojure, vectors and sets are not.

## CreatingReagentComponents
### Form-1
So simple, just a render fuction, which is the same as `React`
```clojure
(defn home []
  (r/as-element
    [:> rn/View
     [:> rn/Text "HOME"]]))
```
When used as `React Component`, the `r/as-element` is necessary.

### Form-2

Let's to see:
```clojure
;; First way trying
(def content (r/atom 0))
(js/setInterval (fn []
                  (swap! content inc)
                  (println @content)) 1000)

(defn home [arg]
  (r/as-element
    [:> rn/View {:style (styles :container)}
     [:> rn/Text @content]]))

;; Second way trying which is correct.
(defn page
  [arg]
  (let [content (r/atom 0)]
    (js/setInterval (fn []
                      (swap! content inc)
                      (println @content)) 1000)
    (fn [arg] ; <------- arg is necessary, forget it is a mistake
      [:> rn/View {:style (styles :container)}
       [:> rn/Text @content]])))

(defn home-screen [:div  "Hello " "You"]
  [arglist]
  (r/as-element [page]))

```

First way, the Component will not update anyway. Because the Component is a standalone unit, the external state will not affect it.<br/>
Second way, anonymous functions will be called when `content` changed, because it's a close over state for Component.  

**Attention, you must use another function to wrap it to be a `React Component`.**
> `Form-2`有些场景使用起来似乎有些赘余，比如`inner function (component)`并不需要传递会更新的参数，只需要使用初始的参数值。这时，可以使用`with-let`代替`let`，内部直接使用`Hiccup`表达式即可。例如：
```clj
;; 以下两种等价
(defn user [x y]
  (r/with-let [name (r/atom "Jack")]
              (println "in let expr" x)
              [:> rn/View {:style {:margin-top 100}}
               [:> rn/Text @name]
               [:> rn/Text x]
               [:> rn/Button {:on-press (fn []
                           [m-view @name @age]               (reset! name (str @name "apple ")))
                              :title    "test"}]]))

(defn user [x y]
  (let [name (r/atom "Jack")]
    (fn []
      [:> rn/View {:style {:margin-top 100}}
       [:> rn/Text @name]
       [:> rn/Text x]
       [:> rn/Button {:on-press (fn []
                                  (reset! name (str @name "apple ")))
                      :title "test"}]])))
```
即使`x, y`改变，引起重新渲染，也不会使得`name`的值重置。

### Form-3

- Use `r/create-class` and `with-meta` to achieve.
- When use a `r/create-class`, You can get the bare React `this`, it also have `state`, `setState`. Attention, the state manager is still `reagent`, `setState` will do nothing for update.
- With a lot of functions to use, such as `r/argv`, `r/children`, `r/props` and so on.


### Summary

- The difference of Form-1 and Form-2 is only that Form-2 support a close over paramters, which as native state of the Component.
- `with-meta` some times can replace `create-class`.
> 事实上`with-meta`并不能完全替代`create-class`。具体请参考文档`create-class的使用`。

## ComponentUpate

- `props`.  A Component can't get new `props` unless its parent rerenders.
  ```clojure
  (defn greet
  [name]          ;; name is a string            
  [:div "Hello " name])

  (defn greet-family
  [] 
  [:div 
    [greet "Dad"]
    [greet (str "Bro-" (rand-int 10))]])
  ```
- `ratoms`.
- `props` and `ratoms` use different way to judge change.(old version useful)

A interesting example. Differ to `React`, the reagent can modify `props` and it's reactive to rerender.<br/>

<br/>

## Refs
Sometimes, we should use `clojure.core/atom` to avoid unecessary rerender.

## Create React Element

-  When you have a React component that wraps children, you can pass Hiccup forms to it wrapped in `as-element`.
- `reactify-component` can transform `Reagent "Components"` to `React Components`. But the reagent components must inlude all parameters in one `prop`. For example:<br/>
  [https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/blob/master/doc/InteropWithReact.md#creating-react-components-from-reagent-components](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/blob/master/doc/InteropWithReact.md#creating-react-components-from-reagent-components)

- A `decorator` example explains clearly the transform between `React Component` and `Reagent Component`.

### Summary

- When a reagent component used in React, must use `as-element` wrapping, although unnecessary for reagent components themselves, which also include `:>` wrapping react components.
- If `as-element` isn't useful, please use `reactify-components`.
- `current-component` can be used to get `props` and `children` for current components.<br/>
